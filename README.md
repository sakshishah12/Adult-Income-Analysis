# Adult-Income-Analysis

In this project, we aim to develop predictive machine learning models that can classify individuals
into two income groups based on their demographic and employment characteristics, earning less
than $50,000 or more than $50,000 annually.
The dataset used is the Adult Income Dataset derived from the 1994 U.S. Census Bureau
database, later cleaned by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker for data mining research. It is publicly
available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
